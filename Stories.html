      <h3>My name is Del and I have been buying Smithard's Dog Co. Products for nearly four years. I have a four-year-old Poodle, Winston, and a two-year-old Golden Retriever, Pepper. About two months after I bought Winston, he stopped eating and starting getting sick. After taking him to the vet, I discovered how unhealthy Winston's Dog Food really was and began researching a healthier option. Smithard's was the healthiest option, and since switching, Winston - and Pepper - have been incredibly healthy and happy. I've never looked back. Thank you Smithard's!</h3>

      <h3>My dog, Jameson, and I live in a small apartment in New York City. He's a big, three-year-old Great Dane who loves to walk and jump around <i>everywhere.</i> After our daily walks around Central Park, I love to give Jameson a treat. About a year and a half ago, Jameson stopped eating the treats I had been regularly giving him. I was confused, but assumed he was not feeling well. After a week of not eating the treats and whimpering when I tried to give them to him, I decided to try a new brand. I happened to fall upon Smithard's. Now, Jameson gobbles down his treats. We're both happier since switching!</h3>

        <h3>My dog, Maisy, is a twelve-year-old chihuahua. Around two years ago, she developed problems with her joints, and now she dislikes walking and I don't have a garden for her to roam around in. A few days after I stopped walking her, I picked her up and noticed she had gotten much heavier and seemed to be whimpering. Soon after, I realized that I had not seen her use the bathroom anywhere - becuase she couldn't! As a person who cares for nature, I looked for an organic, all natural Dog Litter, and the only place I could find one was Smithard's Dog Co. Now we're both happy!</h3>
