    <h3>My name is Kyra Chassaing, and I am the co-founder and CEO of Smithard's Dog Co. I grew up with many dogs and they have been the inspiration for Smithard's since the beginning. I understand that dogs are important to everyone in a different ways, so this company gives me a chance to enhance that love. I decided to make this company all-natural and organic because taking care of my dogs, I realized that there was no similar option on the market. It felt wrong to be giving my best friend something harmful and full of pesticides from an oversized company. I hope you enjoy!</h3>
